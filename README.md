# SweetMatch
Got enough room for dessert? But which kind? Have you ever finished a meal and couldn’t decide which dessert to order? SweetMatch is a Python-based dessert recommendation program designed to help users discover the perfect sweet treat based on their mood and flavor preferences.
SweetMatch will use simple programming logic with creativity to make something fun, interactive, and surprisingly useful.

With SweetMatch, the user answers a few quick questions, such as:

What’s your current mood? (Happy, Cozy, Sad, Adventurous)
What kind of flavor are you craving? (Chocolate, Fruity, Creamy)

Based on the user’s responses, the program will randomly select a dessert that matches their mood and cravings.
For example, someone feeling cozy and craving something chocolatey might be recommended chocolate chip cookies, while someone feeling adventurous and craving fruity flavors might get mango lime cheesecake.

## Source Inspiration
As a starting point, I’ll be adapting and forking the existing Mood Movie repository from the KSU IS GitHub library as my research and foundation: (https://github.com/ksu-is/Mood-Movie).
This project uses Python to recommend movies based on user moods, making it an ideal base for my dessert recommender.
The existing logic for mood-based recommendations will be modified to align with dessert choices rather than film genres, saving development time and providing a strong structure to build from.
